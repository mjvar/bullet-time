# Bullet Time

Bullet Time is a difficult but fair bullet hell that lets you slow time down.

### About

I've always been fascinated by hard games, even though I'm not very good at them. What entices me about them is the feeling of invincibility one gets after failing a level over and over, and then succeeding in the end. In Bullet Time, I strove to make the game feel difficult but also satisfying.

I created pixel art for the first time during this project. I also composed the soundtracks and sound effects myself.

In Bullet Time, you pilot a ship (WASD/arrows) towards a portal, while dodging an onslaught of bullets from enemies. You can also use Slow (SPACE) to more precisely control your ship.

### Slow Meter

While playing, you can slow down time using the SPACE key. This consumes a limited Slow Meter (in the top left) that slows both the bullets and your ship, allowing you to perfectly time and execute tight maneuvers. If you hold the button for too long, though, your Slow Meter depletes, which fast forwards the game back to normal speed.

There are three main enemy types in the game:

### Regular

These enemies shoot bullets in a straight line. They are fairly easy to get around once you get the hang of the basic mechanics.

### Sniper

These enemies aim at your ship and shoot bullets in its direction. Don't stay in one part of the map too long, or else the bullets will catch up with you.

### Berserker

These enemies fire bullets in a constant spiral pattern. You'll have to make clever use of your ship's movement as well as the Slow Meter to get past them.

This game was inspired by the first-person shooter [Superhot](https://superhotgame.com/) as well as the bullet hell [Bullet Fractals](https://nartier.itch.io/bullet-fractals).
